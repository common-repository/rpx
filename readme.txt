Social Login by Janrain

== Description ==
Enable people to quickly register or log in to your site using their existing identities from Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, or dozens of other social networks. Janrain supports more than 30 social networks, email, and identity providers.

This plugin enables integration of Janrain Social Login and social sharing v2 features in a WordPress site. This plugin supports [Janrain Social Login free] (http://janrain.com/product/social-login/basic/).

Janrain Social Login was previously called Janrain Engage. The plugin UI references this legacy name.

#### Social Login
Let visitors register or sign-in to your site with the click of a button with an existing identity from one of [30+ supported social networks](https://rpxnow.com/docs/providers), including Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo!

#### Customizable Interface
Utilize an intuitive visual editor to tailor the size, orientation, style, fonts and colors of your social login interface, or take advantage of simple APIs to create a custom look and feel.

#### Link Social Identities to Existing Accounts
Link a customerâ€™s multiple social identities to a single account on your site, or associate a social profile to an existing customer account on your site.

#### One Click Return Experience
Improve user experience by recognizing returning customers with a one-click login feature.
